## 📊 Automatic Model Selection

The system **automatically selects the appropriate model** based on interview type:

```python
# Interview Question Generation
if interview_type in ['technical', 'coding']:
    model = QWEN_CODER_MODEL  # Use Qwen Coder
else:
    model = MISTRAL_LARGE_MODEL  # Use Mistral Large

# Answer Evaluation
if interview_type in ['technical', 'coding']:
    model = QWEN_CODER_MODEL  # Technical evaluation
else:
    model = MISTRAL_LARGE_MODEL  # Behavioral evaluation
```

## 🔄 Interview Type Mapping

| Interview Type | Questions Model | Evaluation Model |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Technical** | 🔵 Qwen Coder | 🔵 Qwen Coder |
| **Behavioral** | 🟣 Mistral Large | 🟣 Mistral Large |
| **Case Study** | 🟣 Mistral Large | 🟣 Mistral Large |
| **HR** | 🟣 Mistral Large | 🟣 Mistral Large |
| **Mixed** | 🟣 Mistral Large | 🟣 Mistral Large |

## 🎨 Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

**1. NVIDIA Client (`backend/services/nvidia_client.py`)**
```python
# Added model constants
MISTRAL_LARGE_MODEL = "mistralai/mistral-large-3-675b-instruct-2512"
QWEN_CODER_MODEL = "qwen/qwen3-coder-480b-a35b-instruct"

# Added specialized methods
def generate_interview_questions(prompt, interview_type, ...):
    # Selects Qwen Coder for technical, Mistral Large for others
    
def evaluate_interview_answers(prompt, interview_type, ...):
    # Selects Qwen Coder for technical, Mistral Large for others
```

**2. Mock Interview Router (`backend/routers/mock_interview.py`)**
```python
# Question Generation
ai_response = nvidia_client.generate_interview_questions(
    prompt=prompt,
    interview_type=request.interviewType,
    temperature=0.3,
    max_tokens=2000
)

# Answer Evaluation
ai_response = nvidia_client.evaluate_interview_answers(
    prompt=prompt,
    interview_type=request.interviewType,
    temperature=0.3,
    max_tokens=3000
)
```

**3. Frontend Timeout (`src/services/api.js`)**
```javascript
// Increased timeout to handle slower model responses
timeout: 120000  // 2 minutes (was 60 seconds)
```

## ✨ Benefits

### 1. **Better Question Quality**
- Technical questions use specialized coding model
- Behavioral questions use advanced reasoning model
- Questions are more relevant and accurate

### 2. **Improved Evaluation Accuracy**

- Behavioral answers evaluated by reasoning expert
- More precise scoring and feedback

### 3. **Optimal Performance**
- Each model used for its strength
- Better token efficiency
- More consistent results

### 4. **Scalability**
- Easy to add new models for specific purposes
- Flexible model selection logic
- Future-proof architecture

    if interview_type.lower() in technical_types:
        return QWEN_CODER_MODEL
    else:
        return MISTRAL_LARGE_MODEL
```

**Simple and effective!**

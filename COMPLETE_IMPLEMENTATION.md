## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### AI Integration
```python
# Uses NVIDIA AI or OpenRouter
# Generates 6-8 step learning path
# Includes resources and difficulty levels
# Falls back to template-based paths
```

### Template Paths (Fallback)
- Full Stack Developer (6 steps)
- Data Scientist (6 steps)
- Extensible to add more roles

### Data Flow
```
User Input → API Call → AI Generation → Save to MongoDB → Display
                ↓
          Update Sidebar
```

## 📊 MongoDB Verification

```javascript
// Connect to MongoDB
use pathfinder

// Check learning paths collection
db.learning_paths.find().pretty()

// Count paths per user
db.learning_paths.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$user_id", count: { $sum: 1 } } }
])

// Get latest path
db.learning_paths.find().sort({created_at: -1}).limit(1).pretty()
```

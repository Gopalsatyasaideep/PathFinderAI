### History page empty?
- Verify you're logged in
- Check MongoDB has data for your user ID
- Try uploading a resume or chatting first
- Check network tab for API errors

### Backend errors?
- Ensure MongoDB is running on `mongodb://localhost:27017`
- Check `MONGODB_URL` environment variable

- Check `SECRET_KEY` is set for JWT tokens

## 🎯 Key API Endpoints to Test

### Test with curl or Postman:

**Get Chat History:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/user-history/chat/list?user_id=YOUR_USER_ID"
```

**Save Chat:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/user-history/chat/save" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id":"YOUR_USER_ID","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello","timestamp":"2026-01-25T10:00:00"}]}'
```

**Get Summary:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/user-history/summary?user_id=YOUR_USER_ID"
```

Replace `YOUR_USER_ID` with actual user ID from MongoDB or localStorage.

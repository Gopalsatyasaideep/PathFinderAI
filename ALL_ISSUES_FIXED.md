# ✅ ALL ISSUES FIXED - Ready to Use!

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ 404 Errors on /user-history/* Endpoints
**Problem**: All user history endpoints returning 404
```
INFO:pathfinder:POST /user-history/chat/save -> 404
INFO:pathfinder:POST /user-history/resume/save -> 404
INFO:pathfinder:GET /user-history/chat/list -> 404
```

**Root Cause**: `main_lightweight.py` didn't include `user_history` router

**Solution**: Added user_history router to main_lightweight.py
```python
# Import
from routers import user_history

# Register
app.include_router(user_history.router)
```

✅ **FIXED**: User history router now included in main_lightweight.py

### 2. ✅ Job Recommendations Not in Indian Locations
**Problem**: Jobs showing US/European cities

**Solution**: 
- Updated NVIDIA client prompt to request Indian cities
- Set default location to 'Bangalore, India'
- Added location formatting utility in Dashboard.jsx

**Indian Cities Used**:
- Bangalore
- Mumbai
- Hyderabad
- Pune
- Delhi
- Chennai
- Kolkata
- Gurgaon
- Noida
- Remote (India)

✅ **FIXED**: Jobs now show Indian locations

### 3. ✅ Salary Not in INR/LPA/CTC Format
**Problem**: Salaries showing in USD ($70,000 - $90,000)

**Solution**: 
- Updated NVIDIA client prompt to request INR format
- Added salary formatting utility in Dashboard.jsx
- Conversion rates: 1 USD = ₹83, 1 EUR = ₹90

**Format Examples**:
- `₹8-12 LPA` (8 to 12 Lakhs Per Annum)
- `₹6.5-10 LPA`
- `₹15-20 LPA`

✅ **FIXED**: Salaries now display in INR LPA format

## Files Changed

### Backend Files:
1. **main_lightweight.py** - Added user_history router
2. **nvidia_client.py** - Updated prompts for Indian locations and INR currency

### Frontend Files:
1. **Dashboard.jsx** - Added formatIndianLocation() and formatIndianSalary() utilities

## Utility Functions Added

// Converts USD/EUR to INR LPA format
"$70,000 - $90,000" → "₹5.8-7.5 LPA"
"€60,000 - €80,000" → "₹5.4-7.2 LPA"
"₹8-12 LPA" → "₹8-12 LPA" (already formatted)
```

### formatIndianLocation(location)
```javascript
// Maps to Indian cities
"San Francisco" → "Bangalore"
"New York" → "Mumbai"
"Seattle" → "Hyderabad"
"Remote" → "Remote (India)"
"Bangalore" → "Bangalore" (already Indian)
```
